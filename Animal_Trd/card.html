            <p>Siberian Huskies are very curious and very active. They can be very destructive both inside and out. If they
                are left uncrated inside, the breed can destroy a house and cause a wide variety of damage. They are also
                known as an "escape artists" and have been known to wander away and disappear. They can jump fences, break
                tie-out chains, slip collars and find any other way to escape.
                <br> While they enjoy howling, they rarely bark and they will not alert you and bark if someone comes onto your
                property.
